2hour and half

1. intro
2. The build workflow

   - use dependency management tool //npm or yarn
   - use bundler // webpack
   - use compiler(next -get- javascript) // Babel + Presets

it's not complex

3. create react app
   `npx create-react-app react-complete-guide`

create-react-app react-complete-guide --scripts-version1.1.5(??)

4. Understanding the folder structure

- package.json-dependencies
  react, react-dom, react-script

- scripts
  `npm run <script-name>`
  exception is only `npm start`
  `npm run build?` ?? what this doing?

- node modules
  just leave it

- public
  index.html - single page(one html) : id=root(mount our react app) - in here add meta datas and links
- manifest.json we can define meta data here. 고유의 데이터

- src
  actual react app
  index.js get access to root
  App.js
  delete everything in App.css and delete logo.svg
  what serviceWorker.js does?????

5.  Understanding Components basics
    <App> : root component (normally one root component)
    defining two ways of making component : class component class has render method because react will call this render method
    we always need render method or return ( rendering or returning html code)

    - export default App
    - JSX !! - syntethical sugar
    - normally just use .js file to make component

6.  Understanding JSX
    React.createElement()
    take three arguments
    first element that we want to render
    second element is for configuration
    third element is children

- `React.createElement("div", null, "h1", "Hi I am a react app" )`

- do same thing expect render h1 together as text
  change like below
- `React.createElement("div", null, React.createElement("h1", null,"Hi I am a react app" ))`
- for the class Name
- `React.createElement("div", {className:"App"}, React.createElement("h1", null, "Hi I am a react app" ))`
- behind seen code

7.  JSX restrictions

    - class is reserved word in JS so use className
    - must have one root element per component (need to wrap everything)
    - return (html(jsx)) parenthesis

8.  Creating a Functional component

- need to start with capital
- folder also capital
- most time you need to use just javascript function
- function name is lower case! ex6 function
- function with ex6 function
- we need to import react `import React from "react"`
- export default person
- import Person from <address>
- what is benefit to separate component?
